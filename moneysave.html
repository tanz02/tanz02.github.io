		<h2> Advertising </h2>
		<p> Advertising is a key component of businesses. But did you know that you can do very low to no cost advertising using online classified ads?
		We can utilize sites like craigslist for advertising. 
		<br> 
		We can utilize our own resources such as your typical inkjet printer and paper. We can print out our own flyers and post them throughout town. Or you can hand them directly to the
		customer as a coupon. They will be back for those savings. 
		<br>
		<h2> Utilites </h2>
		Be sure to be using energey efficient light bulbs such as an LED lightbulb. They drive the costs down compared to the older incandescent lightbulb. The initial cost may be more but the savings in 
		the end go along way. Keep the heat on at a low setting. Use the air conditoner when it is necessary. 
		<br>
		<h2> Rent </h2>
		Have you looked into solutions such as E-Commerce? E-Commerce might be a way to takle those rental costs down. Doing an online only shopping experience is much cheaper 
		than renting a facility to sell out from. You might even be able to avoid those pesky permit fees. The only cost you might have to pay is renting a server which can be 
		much cheaper than renting out a facility. You can also save costs by utilizing sites like Amazon or Ebay.
